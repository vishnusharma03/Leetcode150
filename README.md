# LeetCode 150
Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Solutions repository! This is a dedicated space where I share my journey through the challenging world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), focusing on the "LeetCode Interview 150" questions. Each day, I tackle a new problem, primarily using Java, and document my solutions and insights here.

## About the Project
This project is a personal endeavor to master DSA and prepare for software engineering interviews. By consistently solving and uploading LeetCode problems, I am building a robust understanding of various algorithms and data structures, enhancing my problem-solving skills.

## Why LeetCode Interview 150?
LeetCode's "Interview 150" is a curated list of questions frequently asked in technical interviews at top tech companies. These questions cover a wide range of topics in DSA, making them an excellent resource for anyone looking to prepare for technical interviews.

## Language: Java
I chose Java for its portability, maintainability, and extensive community support. Solving problems in Java helps me improve my proficiency in a language that's widely used in the industry and known for its application in building scalable, high-performance applications.
